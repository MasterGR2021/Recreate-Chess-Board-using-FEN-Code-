# What is a FEN Code
FEN is the abbreviation of Forsyth-Edwards Notation, and it is the standard notation to describe positions of a chess game. Steven J. Edwards, a computer programmer, created this notation system based on another system designed by the journalist David Forsyth. Edwards modified the older notation system so that chess software could use it.

# Reasons to use FEN
FEN is important because it makes it easy to translate any chess position into a single line of text. It facilitates the process of recreating positions using computers and allows players to share them and restart games from any point they desire.

For this reason, FEN is especially helpful to chess teachers, coaches, trainers, and students. It replaces the need for chess mentors to send large PGN files to their students and speeds up the process of sharing positions, even when people are far apart.
